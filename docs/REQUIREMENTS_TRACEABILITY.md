# Ratel — Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

> **GENERATED** by `ratel-tools/gen_traceability.py` from the 161 requirement IDs in `RATEL_REQUIREMENTS.md`. Do not hand-edit — rerun the generator. To correct a call, edit `ratel-tools/requirements_registry.json` (`overrides`) and rerun.

**How to read this**

- **MoSCoW** is *derived* from the spec (R-A1 v1 boundary · R-A8 launch floor · Part O phases) — interpretive, **please review/override**.
- **Phase**: Foundation/Stage1/Stage2 = local & complete per the S1–S27 build audit · Stage3 = DB/runtime/payments (owner + money gated) · Wave = post-launch (R-O3) · Cut = removed.
- **Status (build)** = completion of the *buildable* slice: `Built ✅` (Stage 1–2, per audit) · `Build-ahead 🟦` (Stage-3 logic written + tested, not yet live) · `Partial 🟨` · `Pending 🔒` (Stage-3, not started) · `Deferred ⏭` (wave) · `Removed ✖`.
- **Gate** = going live needs owner action / money.
- **Evidence** = source/test files citing the requirement ID (a floor — not every built file tags its ID).
